        “Technically there isn’t much of a difference if a project is started from a smaller screen to a bigger screen
        (mobile first) or vice versa (desktop first). Yet it adds extra limitations and helps you make decisions if you
        start with mobile first.” Does your icon have lot of details and some fancy effects applied? If yes, use a
        bitmap. If not, consider using a vector image.” A vector image can more properly adapt to different resolutions.
        By using nesting elements, you can make it so collections of onscreen elements adapt to a shrinking or expanding
        screen as one, instead of individually.
